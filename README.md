# Gender Classification

##Overview

The code uses the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning library to train a few models on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics. 

##Dependencies

* Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
